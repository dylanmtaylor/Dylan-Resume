\section{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\begin{tightemize}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\item {As part of the pipelines team, I developed CI/CD solutions for multiple projects, as well as several container images for builds, some customized Packer images for the internal OpenStack cloud, and a Terraform Tomcat module to deploy Java software within the company in a standardized and approved manner with an ELK stack and our monitoring solution. I also wrote and updated developer-facing documentation to help them adopt DevOps practices and the tooling we developed.}
\item {Helped administer and maintain internal-facing DevOps tooling including GitLab, Artifactory and Xray, as well as documentation sites and a service status page with a Python and SQL backend. As part of this offering, I built and run a production GitLab build runner service utilizing Terraform infrastructure-as-code deployment, virtual machine auto-scaling to meet user demand, secure containerized builds, and monitoring and alerting using Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager.}
\item {Utilized scripting and automation to apply infrastructure as code practices to build-out portions of the IBM Watson Health Cloud for Life Sciences Compliance, while capturing output for regulatory purposes. OpenStack APIs were leveraged to provision both virtual machines and networking. I also aided in processing a documentation to fulfil regulatory requirements.}
\item {Authored a comprehensive Ansible cloud security playbook and a provisioning script solution to deploy and configure Linux machines to meet corporate security standards, enable system logging for auditability, maintain separation of duties, and setup LDAP access so that privileged accounts were not directly accessible.}
\item {Worked as a Site Reliability Engineer for the IBM Bluemix DevOps Services offering, administering thousands of Linux systems across several environments and participating in an 24x7 on-call rotation via PagerDuty to ensure that SLA obligations were met and monitored system and application health for availability, performance, and reliability.}
\item {On the UrbanCode Deploy team, I helped develop the Blueprint Designer component, as well as custom OpenStack heat plugins and a microservice to discover cloud resources and expose them to the frontend in a standardized JSON format. This tool facilitated automated deployment of software and infrustructure to multiple cloud and legacy customer environments.}\end{tightemize}
