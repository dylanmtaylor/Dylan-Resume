\section{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\begin{tightemize}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\item {As part of a development team, worked on architecting and deploying a
Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline for production software
development and wrote an integration testing framework to ensure proper
product functionality. Assisted with work to integrate Docker Trusted
Registry into CI.}
\item {Developed custom OpenStack heat plugins to facilitate the deployment of
customer software to cloud providers using OpenStack heat templates and
UrbanCode Deploy, Chef, and SaltStack components. Utilized multiple
third-party APIs and Python modules.}
\item {Implemented and maintained a service offering REST endpoints using
Flask and Python libraries to authenticate to cloud providers such as
Amazon Web Services, IBM SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure, and VMWare in order
to discover resources and return them in a JSON format.}
\item {Utilized UrbanCode AntHillPro and Gerrit with administrator rights on our
production servers in order to setup automated pre-flight build lives for our
product, pull in repositories for upstream dependencies, maintain build
configurations, and make privileged configuration changes.}
\item {Administered thousands of Linux systems across several cloud providers.
Had billing and ordering capabilities to deploy infrastructure for
product testing and supporting the needs of the business in addition to
providing 24x7 support for our production environments with active
customers via PagerDuty.}
\item {Authored a comprehensive Ansible cloud security playbook and a
parameterized provisioning script solution to configure RHEL and Ubuntu
machines to meet internal IBM security standards, enable system logging
to a QRadar machine for auditability, maintain separation of duties, and
setup LDAP access so that privileged accounts (root) were not used to
log in to the system for accountability reasons. This playbook is
currently used on hundreds of Bluemix virtual machines and bare metal
servers.}
\item {Managed development and production systems using IBM Endpoint Manager
(BigFix). This included writing IEM fixlets using both Bash scripts and
BigFix Action Script, creating conditions to determine if a fixlet was
applicable using Relevance language and writing several analyses to
check the state of the system via command output. Security posture was
checked using a database of vulnerabilities and safe package versions.}
