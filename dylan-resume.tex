\section{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\begin{tightemize}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\item {\textbf{Championing cloud-native development and infrastructure-as-code (IaC):}} Led the development of multiple CI/CD solutions, container images, customized \href{https://www.packer.io/}{Packer} images, and production-grade Terraform repositories/modules, ensuring standardized, scalable deployments within the company's cloud environments. Focused on reusability when developing modules so that the DRY principle could be applied, ensuring uniformity across many accounts and deployments.
\item {\textbf{Scripting and automation:}} Developed a Python-based \href{https://www.selenium.dev/}{Selenium} script for automated environment configuration and testing of a line-of-business application, streamlining deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency. Migrated complex business processes to cloud-native architecture on AWS, utilizing \href{https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/}{Step Functions}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/}{Lambda}, and \href{https://aws.amazon.com/batch/}{Batch}, for efficient job processing and reduced operational costs.
\item {\textbf{Enhancing cloud security posture:}} Developed an \href{https://www.ansible.com/}{Ansible} playbook and provisioning scripts to configure machines to follow corporate standards, ensuring auditability, separation of duties, and LDAP integration. Worked closely with cyber security to build out monitoring and auditing solutions using Security Lake and the \href{https://www.rapid7.com/products/insight-platform/}{Rapid7 Insight Platform} in an automated fashion. 
\item {\textbf{Linux administration:}} Seasoned Linux administrator both as a hobbyist and a professional, with extensive experience in system provisioning, configuration management, performance optimization, and troubleshooting across various distributions. I have contributed to FOSS projects in my spare time, providing code, automation, and packaging for components of \href{https://archlinux.org/}{Arch Linux} (writing \href{https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/graphs/contributors}{Python code for the installer}), \href{https://nixos.org/}{NixOS} (as a package maintainer), and GitHub actions for the \href{https://universal-blue.org/}{Universal Blue images}.
\item {\textbf{Cloud networking:}} Helped to design and implement robust and secure multi-regional cloud network infrastructure using \href{https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/}{VPC}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwan/}{CloudWAN}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/}{AWS network firewall}, \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html}{network security group rules}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/route53/}{Route53}, and Elastic Load Balancers (both \href{https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/}{ALB} and \href{https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/network-load-balancer/}{NLB}). Centralized network routing and configuration for several dozen accounts for enhanced security and manageability.
\item {\textbf{Building deployment and automation tooling:}} As a professional software developer, contributed Java and Python code to the IBM UrbanCode Deploy Blueprint Designer, including the \href{https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/}{OpenStack heat plugins}, and a microservice to discover cloud resources. This tool facilitated automated deployment of software and infrastructure to multiple customer environments.
